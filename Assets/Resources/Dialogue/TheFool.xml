            <string>???: Hey, you're the new wanderer here, right?</string>
            <string>You: I've unfortunately got lost. Where's this place?</string>
            <string>???: Oh, you're in the resting place of the Celestials, not a lot of people can get in or out.</string>
            <string>You: Is there a way out then?</string>            
            <string>???: Not for a witch, no... But life's a journey. Embrace the unknown adventure is your first step.</string>

            <string>Alex: I'm the spirit of The Fool, but you can call me by my human disguise name: Alex.</string>
            <string>You: So, you're the one who's been guiding me all this time?</string>
            <string>Alex: Yes, I'm glad that my effort has pushed you forward, but your next challenge will be much harder.</string>
            <string>You: What's ahead of me then?</string>
            <string>Alex: Look into your intuition, knowledge, and subconsciousness. Good luck, wanderer.</string>
